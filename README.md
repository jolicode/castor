    <i>Castor is a <strong><abbr title="Developer eXperience">DX</abbr> oriented task
    runner</strong> and <strong>command launcher</strong> built with PHP.</i>
</p>

It can be seen as a replacement of Makefile, Fabric, Invoke, Shell scripts...

It comes with many helpers to make your life easier:

* Seamless parsing of **arguments and options**, simplifying input handling
* **Autocomplete** support for faster and error-free command entry
* Effortless **process execution**, enabling seamless integration with external
  tools
* **Parallel processing** capabilities to maximize resource utilization
* Intelligent **file watching** that automatically triggers actions on file
  modifications
* Customizable **notifications** to keep you informed and in control
* Robust **logging** for capturing and analyzing essential information
* A strong emphasis on exceptional **Developer Experience** (DX)

> **Note**
> Castor is still in early development, and the API is not stable yet. Even if
> it not likely to change, it is still possible that it will change in the
> future.

## Usage

As an example, you could create a command that prints "Hello from castor" by creating
a file `castor.php` with the following content:

```php
<?php

namespace greetings;

use Castor\Attribute\AsTask;
use function Castor\run;

#[AsTask]
function hello(): void
{
    run('echo "Hello from castor"');
}
```

Then you can run the command with `castor greetings:hello`:

```bash
$ castor greetings:hello
Hello from castor
```

Then, you can go wild and create more complex commands:

```php
#[AsTask(description: 'Clean the infrastructure (remove container, volume, networks)')]
function destroy(bool $force = false)
{
    if (!$force) {
        io()->warning('This will permanently remove all containers, volumes, networks... created for this project.');
        io()->comment('You can use the --force option to avoid this confirmation.');

        if (!io()->confirm('Are you sure?', false)) {
            io()->comment('Aborted.');

            return;
        }
    }

    run('docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans --volumes --rmi=local');

    notify('The infrastructure has been destroyed.')
}
```

usage](doc/02-basic-usage.md) documentation, or browse the [examples](examples)
directory.

## Questions and answers

### How is Castor different from raw Symfony Console usage?

Castor is a task runner, so it's primary goal is to run simple tasks to simplify
the project development. Usually, it is used to run Docker commands, database
migrations, cache clearing, etc.

Usually, tasks are very small, like 1 or 2 lines of code. So you probably don't
want to waste your project with ops command that are not strictly related to the
business.

### Why "Castor"?

Castor means "beaver" in french. It's an animal building stuff. And this is what
this tool does: it helps you build stuff üòÅ
