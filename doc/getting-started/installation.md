# Installation and Autocomplete

## Installation

### With the installer

> [!TIP]
> This is the recommended way to install Castor. It requires PHP >= 8.1.

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jolicode/castor/main/installer/bash-installer" | bash
```

### As a phar

You can download the latest release of Castor as a phar file from the [releases
page](https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also download the latest version by browsing [the build
> page](https://castor.jolicode.com/install/latest) and
> selecting the last build.

We provide different phar for Linux / MacOS / Windows architectures to offer
lighter phar files. Download the correct one and make it available in your
shell:

#### Phar for Linux

```bash
curl "https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases/latest/download/castor.linux-amd64.phar" -Lfso $HOME/.local/bin/castor && \
    chmod u+x $HOME/.local/bin/castor && \
    castor --version || \
    (echo "Could not install castor. Is the target directory writeable?" && (exit 1))
```

> [!CAUTION]
> When using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you should still use the
> Windows phar instead of the Linux phar.

#### Phar for MacOS with Apple Silicon

For Mac with Apple Silicon processors (M1, M2, M3, etc).

```bash
curl "https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases/latest/download/castor.darwin-arm64.phar" -Lfso /usr/local/bin/castor && \
    chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/castor && \
    castor --version || \
    (echo "Could not install castor. Is the target directory writeable?" && (exit 1))
```

#### Phar for MacOS with Intel

For Mac with old Intel processors.

```bash
curl "https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases/latest/download/castor.darwin-amd64.phar" -Lfso /usr/local/bin/castor && \
    chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/castor && \
    castor --version || \
    (echo "Could not install castor. Is the target directory writeable?" && (exit 1))
```

#### Phar for Windows

```bash
curl.exe "https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases/latest/download/castor.windows-amd64.phar" -Lso C:\<a directory in your PATH>\castor
```

### Without PHP

If you don't have PHP installed on your system, Castor can also be installed
with a static binary that embeds PHP, so it can be run anywhere. The static
binaries are available for Linux and MacOS AMD64 architectures only.

You can download the binaries in the [releases
page](https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases):

#### Binary for Linux

```bash
curl "https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases/latest/download/castor.linux-amd64" -Lfso $HOME/.local/bin/castor && \
    chmod u+x $HOME/.local/bin/castor && \
    castor --version || \
    (echo "Could not install castor. Is the target directory writeable?" && (exit 1))
```

#### Binary for MacOS with Intel

```bash
curl "https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases/latest/download/castor.darwin-amd64" -Lfso /usr/local/bin/castor && \
    chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/castor && \
    castor --version || \
    (echo "Could not install castor. Is the target directory writeable?" && (exit 1))
```

### Globally with Composer

> [!WARNING]
> Installing Castor globally with Composer is not recommended. Installing CLI
> tools globally with Composer may easily lead to conflicts in the "global"
> project.

You can install Castor globally with Composer:

```bash
composer global require jolicode/castor
```

Then make sure that the Composer global bin directory is in your `PATH`.

> [!NOTE]
> The global Composer path may vary depending on your operating system.

You can run the following command to determine it:

```bash
composer config --list --global | grep -F "[home]"

# It may looks like this on some Linux systems:
# [home] /home/<your_username>/.config/composer
# Or like this too:
# [home] /home/<your_username>/.composer
```

You can optionally replace `/home/<your_username>` with the Unix
`$HOME` environment variable. Now, append `/vendor/bin` to that path to get the
Composer global bin directory to add to your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

Any binary globally installed with Composer will now work everywhere.

### Manually with git

You'll need to clone the repository and run `composer install` to
install the project. Then create a symlink to the `castor` file in your `PATH`.

```bash
cd $HOME/somewhere
git clone git@github.com:jolicode/castor.git
cd castor
composer install
ln -s $PWD/bin/castor $HOME/.local/bin/castor
```

### In a Github Action

Castor can also be installed in a Github Action by using the action `shivammathur/setup-php@v2` and specifying
`castor` in the `tools` option. This will configure PHP with the right version but also make castor available
in the next steps. Here is an example:

```bash
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.1'
          tools: castor

      - name: Run castor "hello" task
        run: castor hello
```

## Autocomplete

Castor provides a built-in autocomplete to ease its usage in shell.

See [the dedicated documentation](../going-further/interacting-with-castor/autocomplete.md)
to see how to install it, and also how to autocomplete your arguments.

## Stubs

The first time you run castor, it will create a `.castor.stub.php` at the root
directory of your project (where your `castor.php` is). This file contains some
definition of classes and methods from Castor and some of its dependencies.

This is useful when you install Castor from a PHAR, from a global composer
install, etc. Without it, your IDE would complain that it does not understand some
classes and would not provide any autocompletion in your castor files.

We suggest you to add this file to your `.gitignore` to not version it in git.
Castor will automatically update this file the first time you run Castor after
you install or update it.
