# Examples

## Builtin examples

Castor's repository provides a bunch of usage examples in the
[examples directory](https://github.com/jolicode/castor/tree/main/examples).
These examples are useful to show different Castor features in action, do not
hesitate to browse them.

As a side note, these examples also act as a full test suite for Castor to
ensure each feature works as expected.
